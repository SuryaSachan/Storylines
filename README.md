# Storylines
Implement the information in the two csv files as a graph and write functions to output the following:
(a) Function: average. Should print the average number of characters each Marvel character is
associated with, as a float upto two decimal places.
Sample random output:
$java assignment4 nodes.csv edges.csv average
7.43

(b) Function: rank. Should print a sorted list of all characters, with comma as delimiter (only comma,
as delimiter and no space). Sorting should be in descending order of co-occurrence with other
characters. That is, characters with more co-occurrences appear before. If there is a tie between
characters based on co-occurrence count, then the order should be descending based on
lexicographic order of the character strings.
You can implement any O(nlogn) sorting algorithm. The test input file will be a huge graph and
we will run the evaluation cases with timeout. If you implement O(n^2) sorting instead of
O(nlogn) then the cases will timeout, and you will lose marks. Also don’t use Java inbuilt sorting,
but implement on your own. We will check your imports against allowed_imports.txt.
Sample random output:
$java assignment4 nodes.csv edges.csv rank

(c) Function: independent_storylines_dfs. Should implement DFS, then find independent storylines,
that have no edge across them, using DFS. Print the characters in each independent storyline, as a
separate line in the output.
The largest storyline (with maximum characters) should appear at the top, followed by the second
largest and so on. Within each line, the character names should be delimited with comma, and
lexicographically sorted in descending order. If two storylines have same number of characters,
ties should be broken in lexicographically descending order of character names.
Sample random output:
$java assignment4 nodes.csv edges.csv independent_storylines_dfs
